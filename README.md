# Classification-of-papers-by-their-abstract
The main goal of this project is Classification of papers by their abstract. 
in the dataframe attached, there are 2230 abstracts of diffrent papers with binarry label pf 0,1.
Label 1 means that the abstract is from a paper about 'social media' and label 0 means it's not.
At the begining of this project, it is shown how to preprocess the raw database into a matrix of features so it will be easier to train the model.
Then by the matrix that is extracted, 2 diffrent models were trained and compaired.
